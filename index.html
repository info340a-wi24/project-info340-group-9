                <!--our problem description-->
                <p> For our topic, we are focusing on how we can better inform and acclimate first-year students,
                    transfers, and commuters into campus life at UW Seattle. Since all of us have either been or still are in their positions, we’ve had the universal experience
                    of trying to navigate the abundance of UW resources and then resorting to Reddit searches when we couldn’t find the
                    answers we needed. </p>
                <p> On top of having an overwhelming amount of information to look through, much of it is not informed
                    by student experiences.
                    For example, consider the following persona: Abby, who is a transfer student from Edmonds Community
                    College and commutes
                    to UW Seattle by car, wants to know which parking garage is most convenient and inexpensive to park.
                    She would like to
                    leave her lunch there while she goes from class to class. As a new student, she would have to dig
                    through the various
                    UW Sites such as <a href="https://www.washington.edu/omad/louis-stokes-alliance-for-minority-participation/" target="_blank">LSAMP</a>, the <a href="https://ctc.fyp.uw.edu/" target="_blank">Commuter Common Site</a>, and the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/ecc/" target="_blank">ECC</a> site to get answers to these
                    questions. Alternatively, she might search up answers based on firsthand experiences via Reddit, but given the
                    specificity of her issue,
                    there’s only one relevant post from a few years ago, so she can’t be sure this information is
                    up-to-date and accurate. Our website application is intended to solve this issue by consolidating accurate and
                    experience-based information all in one place.
