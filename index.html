            <main>
                <!--our problem description-->
                <p> For our topic, we are focusing on how we can better inform and acclimate first-year students,
                    transfers, and commuters into campus life at UW Seattle. Since all of us have either been or still are in their positions, we’ve had the universal experience
                    of trying to navigate the abundance of UW resources and then resorting to Reddit searches when we couldn’t find the
                    answers we needed. </p>
                <p> On top of having an overwhelming amount of information to look through, much of it is not informed
                    by student experiences.
                    For example, consider the following persona: Abby, who is a transfer student from Edmonds Community
                    College and commutes
                    to UW Seattle by car, wants to know which parking garage is most convenient and inexpensive to park.
                    She would like to
                    leave her lunch there while she goes from class to class. As a new student, she would have to dig
                    through the various
                    UW Sites such as <a href="https://www.washington.edu/omad/louis-stokes-alliance-for-minority-participation/" target="_blank">LSAMP</a>, the <a href="https://ctc.fyp.uw.edu/" target="_blank">Commuter Common Site</a>, and the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/ecc/" target="_blank">ECC</a> site to get answers to these
                    questions. Alternatively, she might search up answers based on firsthand experiences via Reddit, but given the
                    specificity of her issue,
                    there’s only one relevant post from a few years ago, so she can’t be sure this information is
                    up-to-date and accurate. Our website application is intended to solve this issue by consolidating accurate and
                    experience-based information all in one place.
                    
                </p>

                <h2>App Description</h2>
            </header>
            <main>
                <!--our app description-->
                <p>Our application will serve as a platform that increases awareness about the resources, traditions, and information
                   available to students at the University of Washington, consolidating that information in one place. In particular,
                   we believe that this service will be most applicable to those who do not have much experience living on or around
                   campus, especially new or incoming students, transfer students, and those who commute. Students who have been
                   involved in campus life for some time may already know the ins and outs of the UW experience, but with our app, we
                   hope to make the transition much easier for groups that are new to the UW community. Nevertheless, students at any
                   point in their undergraduate career may benefit from our site as it is intended to offer a much more comprehensive
                   collection of informal resources by and for students. Additionally, it is our hope that this service will act as a
                   meaningful resource for minority students, with sections dedicated to information about OMA&D, LSAMP, the ECC,
                   affinity RSOs, and other major-specific services like UDS.</p>
                <p>Our platform will work similarly to a University of Washington “wiki” page, consolidating important information in
                    one place, with sections dedicated to different parts of UW life. Our chosen features are intended to better
                    facilitate a meaningful experience for our users. One feature to help do so is a button that will ask something
                    like “is this information helpful?” In addition, we will have feedback popups to ensure our content is useful and
                    within our guidelines. Finally, we will include bookmarking so that users can save something and return to it later.
                    This bookmarking feature may be especially helpful to commuters, particularly if they want to save information about
                    a particular parking area and return to it in the future.</p>
