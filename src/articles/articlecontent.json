        "title": "Navigating Majors and the Capacity-Constrained System",
        "text": "<p>UW is infamously known for its capacity-constrained major system. It's the hallmark of the UW experience, creating a highly stressful and competitive academic environment. If you are unfamiliar with the capacity-constrained system, it essentially boils down to UW not having enough faculty to support major departments. As a result, you may still find yourself competing for classes in your senior year due to students largely outnumbering faculty.</p><p>However, let’s focus on getting you into your desired major first.</p><ol><li>The most important thing you can do for yourself before you apply for a major is to check your expectations. Sometimes, you can have a really good portfolio but still get rejected, and that’s okay. It’s not an indicator of your success at UW - if anything, it opens up the possibilities for your area of study at UW. Have backups! If you are only interested in majors that happen to be capacity-constrained, consider at least one or two that are open or only have a few requirements. You can view UW's undergraduate majors and learn more about their requirements: https://advising.uw.edu/degree-overview/majors/list-of-undergraduate-majors/</li><li>You should also be doing a degree audit! Whether your desired major is open, minimum requirement, or capacity-constrained, you will benefit from a degree audit on MyPlan. You can also plan out future quarters on MyPlan and audit your future schedule too. This will give you a better idea of whether your desired major even fits into your schedule, including course prerequisites.</li><li>Now that you’ve started to plan out course prerequisites, we need to talk about weedouts. Weedouts are notoriously difficult classes that are often required in order to apply to capacity-constrained majors (primarily STEM). If you are set on applying for a major with weedouts, start building good study habits, make use of tutoring https://academicsupport.uw.edu clue/ , and form a study group! This is crucial. Even the best students work in study groups with their peers. The capacity-constrained system can sometimes make students forget that they can benefit more from working together - so don’t hesitate to form a study group early on!</li><li>Write a strong application essay. We know - you probably thought you were done with application essays after getting into UW, but many capacity-constrained majors ask you to write about why you’re interested in applying. This is your opportunity to show what you’re passionate about but also to demonstrate that you will be successful in the major. Some majors provide guidelines/criteria so make sure you look through those guidelines thoroughly. Don’t be afraid to seek out writing help! Here’s a UW resource for application writing: https://guides.lib.uw.edu/c.php?g=342041&p=6489719</li><li>UW also has multiple writing centers such as the Odegaard Writing and Research Center (https://depts.washington.edu/owrcweb/wordpress/) You can make an appointment or simply drop-in during their hours of operation. CLUE also offers an evening writing center for drop-ins (virtual and in-person) https://academicsupport.uw.edu/clue/ </li><li>Lastly, talk to the departmental advisor for your major. They can offer helpful insight and guidance about what to expect from your desired major. Many advisors offer drop-in hours or schedule by appointment, so if you have 15-20 minutes to spare, you can learn a lot about potential career pathways and better prepare yourself for your major. That being said, you don’t have to do everything your advisor tells you - if you are passionate about your major, apply!</li></ol><p>The capacity-constrained system is certainly tough but not impossible to navigate as long as you prepare yourself. Remember that UW has a wide number of departments and majors, so if you don’t get your first pick, you can still find a major that shares similar coursework. At the end of the day, your major is only a small part of your UW experience and a fraction of your identity. Whatever major you declare, you will have vast opportunities to succeed as long as you know how to utilize the resources available to you.</p>"
